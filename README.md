# Project Background
## Connect Four!
The game of Connect Four is described by Wikipedia as follows:
[Connect Four] is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one’s own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. In this assignment you will construct a simple game of Connect Four. This game will be played between two human players, and will be played until one player wins or a stalemate is reached. A simple demonstration of the Connect Four game is displayed in Figure 1.

## Super Connect Four
In this task you will implement a variant of the classic Connect Four game we will call “Super Connect Four”. In this variant of the game when a player connects four or more discs in a row, those discs will be removed from the grid. This will cause any discs above the removed discs to move down to fill the space in the grid left by the removal of the connected discs. One point will be added to the score of the player who connected the discs. If another line of four or more discs belonging to one player exists after all affected discs have been moved, then this process is repeated. This process continues until the grid reaches a stable state where no more lines of four discs exist and no more cells need to be moved. One turn of such a game is demonstrated.
